Title: The Impact of Sleep on Cognitive Function in Adults
This study investigates the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive performance among adults aged 25 to 50. A sample of 300 participants was divided into three groups based on self-reported average sleep duration: short (<6 hours), normal (7â€“8 hours), and long (>9 hours). Cognitive tests covering memory, attention, and problem-solving were administered.
